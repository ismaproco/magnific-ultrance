I added the path recognition of css files in the server file, so I will be able to use styles, and separate the styles from the html file.

- Then I searched for the fileReader API, so I can preview the image in the browser without the need to upload the image to the server.

- Then I research on how to get the average color of an Image element using javascript, this is the best answer I could fine.

- Then I separate the average function into two methods, one to get the full image data, 

function getContextImage

and another to calculate the averege of a section of a canvas context.

function getAverageRGBByContextSection

- Then I look up for a way to draw an svg on a canvas and found this:
